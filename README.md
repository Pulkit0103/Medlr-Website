# Medicine-App
- A Nextjs based frontend app with Backend API in Next.js and Express + MySQL database.
- I have deployed the application on Vercel.

## Tech-Stack

## Working
- The user can put any text in the Input Box.
- The app will show the Matching Medicine Names(Partially Matched names also shown).
- The Search Results has been Paginated. It will show only 10 Results on a Single Page.
- Each Entry is Represented in the form of an Individual Text Box, Which can display the relevant information accordingly.
- The app also has sorting features on the basis of Price Ascending or Descending, Names ascending or descending.
- The UI and Functionalities are working perfectly as designed.

## Branches
I have worked on Frontend + Backend Simultaneously.
Level - 1 Basic Search Implementation + Set Up the Backend:
      - I have made the Input text box and setup the Backend.
Level - 2 [step-2 branch] Additional Search Features and Enhanced UI/UX:
      - Partial Matching has been added as pre Query.
      - I have added Filtering + sorting Functionalities in the Frontend + Backend.
      - I have enhanced the UI.
Level - 3 [step-3 branch] Pagination/Infinite Scroll, and Multi-Search:
      - I have added Pagination facility. Infinite Scroll is very easy to add.
      - Multi-Search works can be added in the similar way.
